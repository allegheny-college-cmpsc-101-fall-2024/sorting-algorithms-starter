# Sorting Algorithms

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers inside of this file and
either remove or rewrite the prompts. When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing this paragraph!

## 1. Research Report

This reflection section is a lab report documenting your work to learn
about doubling experiments, and the connection to time complexity analysis.

### Research Questions

TODO: Clearly state at least three research questions that you want to ask and
answer by using the `listsorting` program. You should provide the research
questions in a list with three entries that each start with "RQ" and end with a
question mark. The RQ's you write must be possible to answer with the
`listsorting` program and connect to time complexity analysis of algorithms
via doubling experiments. You may find it helpful to consider following
parameters as you think of research questions.

TODO: Clearly state at least three research questions that can be answered by
using the `listsorting` program. Make sure that your research questions cover
different aspects of the sorting algorithms provided by the `listsorting` program.

- The specific sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort or merge sort)
- The starting size of the data container: small values (e.g., 1024 numbers) up
  to big values (e.g., 1,048,576 numbers)
- The total number of doubles conducted during the experiment (e.g., 5 or 10)

- RQ1: TODO: fill in question and continue the RQs

### Experiment Design

TODO: Explain how you can use your program to answer your research questions.
Please justify your choice for your experimental parameters and how you plan
to accommodate algorithms that may present issues due to timing inefficiencies.

### Raw Data / Program Output

TODO: Report at least five examples of program output to demonstrate that your
`listsorting` program works correctly. This output should also serve as your
raw data that you can analyze to address your research questions above. The
five outputs could come from the following calls, but more can be added as you
need to support your specific research questions.

- First output from running the `listsorting` program with bubble_sort
- Second output from running the `listsorting` program with insertion_sort
- Third output from running the `listsorting` program with merge_sort
- Fourth output from running the `listsorting` program with quick_sort
- Fifth output from running the `listsorting` program with tim_sort
- additional as needed to support your RQs.

### Processed Data Tables

TODO: Run any calculations needed to analyze your raw data above. For
example, you may need to compute doubling ratios for various algorithms,
and for multiple consecutive doublings.
The exact calculations will depend on your RQs. Please make a markdown
table that can help you organize and label your calculation results.

### Description of Empirical Results

TODO: Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which sorting algorithm is
fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was faster,
referencing the results you obtained in the previous sections. Speculate on why
certain coding constructs or configurations in the sorting algorithms are faster
than others, mentioning specific python constructs.

TODO: Ensure that your description specifically includes the doubling
ratios that are suggested by your empirical results using mathematical
markdown syntax, like that found in the README under Expected Output.
Check the syntax correctness using VS Code's Preview of Markdown.

TODO: Ensure that you address each the three research questions that you posed
in a previous section.

TODO: Reminder: When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing prompts!

### Analytical Interpretation of Empirical Results

TODO: Use the doubling ratio that arises from your empirical results
to suggest the likely worst-case time complexity of the studied algorithms.

- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- tim sort

TODO: Confirm that your empirically-derived time complexity matches theory.
Specifically, use the provided source code for the different sorting algorithms, your
textbook, or any relevant online resources that you
cite in this reflection, to define the worst-case time complexity, using the big-O
notation, for the five sorting algorithms.

## 2. Professional Development

TODO: Answer the following questions below in your own words.

- What is challenging about designing an experiment to evaluate a sorting algorithm's performance?
- What is challenging about big-O notation?
- Do the empirical results suggest that you don't yet know the entire story about the performance of sorting algorithms?
- Briefly comment on your personal experience so far using VS Code
